## About
This game was developed by me and two teammates. Here, the user can play a very unique board game called cross game. This game was heavily designed with MVC, observer, and strategy design patterns.

The game was developed by me and two teammates as a final project. Here, a user can play against a computer or against another human. The goal of the game is for the user to move all their arrows to the opposite side of the board.
