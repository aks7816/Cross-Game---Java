## Design

The game utilizes UML design
### View
  - User inputs and selections
  - Display of turns and text
  - The interaction with the button calls the controller
### Controller:
  - Takes controls from the view and processes them
  - Sends information to model for updates
  - Allows the view to make the visual changes necessary
### Model
  - Keeps track of the state of the game
  - Moves pieces and sends information to the controller
