## About
The game was developed by me and two teammates as a final project. Here, a user can play against a computer or against another human. The goal of the game is for the user to move all their arrows to the opposite side of the board. Also, this game records the highest score (Lowest number of moves) for each round.

This is for two players!

## Design

The game utilizes UML design
### View

### Controller:
  - Takes controls from the view and processes them
